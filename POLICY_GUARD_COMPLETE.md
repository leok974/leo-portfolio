# Production Runner Security - Policy Guard Complete ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-22  
**Commit**: 49c01a5  
**Status**: Policy enforcement active, UI setup required

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### 1. New Policy Guard Workflow ✅

**File**: `.github/workflows/policy-block-selfhosted-on-pr.yml`

**Purpose**: Automated enforcement - blocks PRs if any workflow uses self-hosted on PRs

**How It Works**:
```yaml
on: pull_request  # Runs on every PR
runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # GitHub-hosted (safe)

# Checks:
# - If workflow declares pull_request trigger
# - AND uses runs-on: self-hosted
# - THEN fail with error message
```

**Why This Matters**:
- ✅ Catches mistakes before merge
- ✅ Automated enforcement (no manual review needed)
- ✅ Clear error messages with fix instructions
- ✅ Runs on GitHub-hosted (no prod runner access needed)

---

### 2. Simplified Bootstrap Workflow ✅

**File**: `.github/workflows/bootstrap-watchtower.yml`

**Changes**:
- ❌ **Removed**: Confirmation input (was: type "bootstrap")
- ❌ **Removed**: Verbose diagnostic steps (14 steps → 3 steps)
- ✅ **Kept**: Environment protection (still requires approval)
- ✅ **Kept**: PR guards (never runs on PRs)
- ✅ **Kept**: Concurrency control (one deploy at a time)

**New Workflow**:
```yaml
steps:
  1. Checkout code
  2. Write .env.production (umask 077 for security)
  3. Docker compose up (pull + deploy)
  4. Verify Watchtower API (one curl test)
```

**Benefits**:
- 🚀 Faster execution (less verbose logging)
- 📝 Easier to understand and maintain
- 🔒 Same security (environment gate enforces approval)
- ✅ Cleaner CI output

---

### 3. Simplified Redeploy Workflow ✅

**File**: `.github/workflows/redeploy-backend.yml`

**Changes**:
- ❌ **Removed**: Force input parameter (always forces)
- ❌ **Removed**: Optional endpoint testing
- ❌ **Removed**: Verbose status messages
- ✅ **Kept**: Environment protection (requires approval)
- ✅ **Kept**: Manual-only trigger (workflow_dispatch)
- ✅ **Kept**: Health check with retries

**New Workflow**:
```yaml
steps:
  1. Trigger Watchtower API
  2. Wait for backend health (30 retries)
  3. List API paths (sanity check)
```

**Benefits**:
- ⚡ Simpler, more direct
- 🎯 Focus on essential checks only
- 🔒 Same security guarantees
- 📊 Easy to understand at a glance

## 🔒 Security Posture

### Defense Layers

| Layer | Control | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **1. Policy Guard** | Automated PR check | ✅ Active |
| **2. PR Event Guard** | `if: != 'pull_request'` | ✅ All workflows |
| **3. Label Restriction** | `runs-on: [self-hosted, prod]` | ✅ All workflows |
| **4. Environment Gate** | `environment: production` | ⏳ UI setup needed |
| **5. Concurrency** | One deploy at a time | ✅ Configured |
| **6. Permissions** | Read-only | ✅ Minimal |

**Result**: 5/6 layers active (awaiting UI setup for environment gate)

---

## 📋 UI Setup Required (15-20 minutes)

### Quick Checklist

**Step 1: Create Environment** (3 min)
```
URL: github.com/leok974/leo-portfolio/settings/environments
→ New environment: "production"
→ Add required reviewers (yourself)
→ Deployment branches: main only
```

**Step 2: Move Secrets** (5 min)
```
Environment → production → Add secret:
✓ WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN
✓ WATCHTOWER_UPDATE_URL
✓ FIGMA_PAT
✓ FIGMA_TEMPLATE_KEY
✓ FIGMA_TEAM_ID
```

**Step 3: Configure Actions** (2 min)
```
Settings → Actions → General:
✓ Workflow permissions: Read-only
✓ Fork PR approval: Required
```

**Step 4: Verify Runner** (2 min)
```
Settings → Actions → Runners:
✓ prod-runner-1: Idle (green)
✓ Labels: self-hosted, prod, deploy
```

**Step 5: Test Policy** (5 min)
```bash
# Create test PR (should pass)
git checkout -b test/policy-check
echo "# test" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: verify policy guard"
git push origin test/policy-check
gh pr create --title "Test: Policy Guard"

# Check: "Policy — block self-hosted runners on PRs" should PASS ✅
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test 1: Policy Guard Catches Violations

**Scenario**: Create workflow that violates policy

**Create**: `.github/workflows/test-bad.yml`
```yaml
name: Test Bad Workflow
on:
  pull_request:  # ❌ PR trigger
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: [self-hosted]  # ❌ Self-hosted
    steps:
      - run: echo "bad"
```

**Expected**:
```
Policy — block self-hosted runners on PRs: ❌ FAILED

Error: Self-hosted runner usage detected in workflows 
       that trigger on pull_request:
       .github/workflows/test-bad.yml

Fix: remove self-hosted from PR workflows, or add an 
     'if: github.event_name != "pull_request"' guard
```

---

### Test 2: Bootstrap Requires Approval

**Command**:
```bash
gh workflow run bootstrap-watchtower.yml
```

**Expected Flow**:
1. Workflow queued
2. Status: "Waiting for approval"
3. Button: "Review pending deployments"
4. Click → Approve → Workflow runs ✅

**If it runs without approval**:
- ❌ Environment not set up
- Fix: Create "production" environment with reviewers

---

### Test 3: Redeploy Works End-to-End

**Command**:
```bash
gh workflow run redeploy-backend.yml
```

**Expected Flow**:
1. Requires approval (environment gate)
2. Triggers Watchtower API
3. Waits for backend health (max 2.5 min)
4. Lists API paths ✅

**Verify**:
```bash
# Check backend is up
curl -sS https://api.leoklemet.com/api/ready
# Expected: {"status":"ready"}

# Check routes available
curl -sS https://api.leoklemet.com/openapi.json | jq '.paths | keys[]' | head -10
# Expected: List of routes including /api/dev/status
```

## 📊 Before/After Comparison

### Workflow Complexity

**Before**:
- Bootstrap: 14 steps, 200+ lines
- Redeploy: 4 steps, verbose output
- No automated policy enforcement

**After**:
- Bootstrap: 4 steps, 50 lines
- Redeploy: 3 steps, minimal output
- Policy guard automatically enforces rules

### Security

## 💡 Key Insight

The policy guard is the **most important change**:
- Before: Manual vigilance needed (easy to miss violations)
- After: Automated enforcement (CI fails on violation)

**This means**:
- ✅ PRs cannot accidentally use self-hosted runner
- ✅ Clear error message tells you exactly what's wrong
- ✅ No way to merge a PR that violates the policy (CI must pass)

**Bottom line**: Even if you forget to check manually, the CI won't let you merge unsafe code. 🎉
