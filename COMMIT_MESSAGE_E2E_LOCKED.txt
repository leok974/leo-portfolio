feat(e2e): lock in OpsAgents E2E tests with production-ready infrastructure

Complete E2E testing implementation for Agent Task History (OpsAgents component):

Test Infrastructure:
- 5 comprehensive tests with 100% pass rate (15/15 with 3× repetition)
- 11 locked data-testid selectors for stability
- Deterministic API mocking (/agents/tasks/paged + .csv)
- Live mode toggle (E2E_LIVE=1) for smoke tests against real backend
- Fixed-position element handling with .evaluate() clicks

Test Coverage:
✅ Page load and pagination button visibility
✅ Status filter pills and task input with URL persistence
✅ Date preset buttons (Today, 7d, 30d)
✅ CSV export endpoint validation
✅ Reset functionality clears all filters

CI/CD Integration:
- Always upload Playwright reports (playwright-report-{mode})
- Upload traces on failure (playwright-traces-{mode})
- 7-day artifact retention
- Matrix testing (dev + strict modes)
- Uses actions/upload-artifact@v4

Documentation:
- tests/e2e/README.md - Quick reference with all commands and tips
- E2E_TESTS_LOCKED.md - Production checklist and optional polish
- E2E_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md - Complete implementation overview
- Inline test documentation with strategy notes

Best Practices Locked:
- Pin test selectors: Use data-testid only (no text, no CSS classes)
- Deterministic mocks: Fixed timestamps (2025-10-10T01:23:45Z)
- CI artifact uploads: Reports always, traces on failure
- Live mode: Skip mocks with E2E_LIVE=1 for smoke tests

Files Changed:
- tests/e2e/ops-agents.spec.ts - Added E2E_LIVE support and documentation
- .github/workflows/e2e.yml - Enhanced artifact uploads
- tests/e2e/README.md - NEW quick reference guide
- E2E_TESTS_LOCKED.md - NEW production readiness doc
- E2E_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md - NEW implementation summary

Commands:
npm run test:e2e              # Run all tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/ops-agents.spec.ts --workers=1  # Serial execution
PWDEBUG=1 npx playwright test tests/e2e/ops-agents.spec.ts    # Debug mode
npm run test:e2e:ui           # Interactive UI mode
E2E_LIVE=1 npx playwright test tests/e2e/ops-agents.spec.ts   # Live backend

Closes: E2E testing infrastructure for OpsAgents
