# UI Polish CI Setup - Quick Summary

## ✅ What Was Created

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/e2e-ui-polish.yml`

**Triggers on PR changes to**:
- `tests/e2e/**`
- `src/styles/**`
- `tailwind.config.*`
- `package.json`

**What it does**:
1. Builds the site
2. Installs Playwright (Chromium only)
3. Verifies `tw-animate-css` import exists
4. Runs UI polish tests (frontend-only)
5. Uploads trace files on failure

**Runtime**: ~2-3 minutes per PR

### 2. NPM Scripts Added

```json
{
  "test:ui-polish": "playwright test -g \"@ui-polish\"",
  "test:ui-polish:ci": "cross-env PLAYWRIGHT_GLOBAL_SETUP_SKIP=1 playwright test -g \"@ui-polish\" --project=chromium",
  "trace:open": "playwright show-trace test-results/**/trace.zip"
}
```

### 3. CI Hardening Features

✅ **Import Guard**: Fails if `tw-animate-css` import is missing
✅ **Chromium-only**: Faster CI runs (~50% speedup)
✅ **Trace upload**: Auto-saves debugging traces on failure
✅ **Frontend-only**: Skips backend setup for speed

## 🚀 Usage

### Local Development

```powershell
# Quick test (skip backend)
$env:PLAYWRIGHT_GLOBAL_SETUP_SKIP='1'; npm run test:ui-polish

# CI mode (exactly as CI runs it)
npm run test:ui-polish:ci

# View traces after failure
npm run trace:open
```

### In CI

Automatically runs on every PR that touches:
- E2E tests
- Styles/CSS
- Tailwind config
- Dependencies

### Manual Trigger

You can also trigger manually from GitHub Actions UI.

## 📊 Test Coverage

| Test | What It Validates |
|------|-------------------|
| ✅ tw-animate-css | Animation utilities work |
| ✅ text-shadow-lg | Tailwind v4.1 built-in |
| ✅ hover-glow | Custom utility effect |
| ✅ aspect-video | Tailwind v4.1 built-in |

## 🛡️ What It Protects Against

- Accidental removal of `tw-animate-css` import
- Breaking Tailwind config changes
- Custom utility deletions
- Plugin regressions
- CSS build failures

## 🔍 Debugging Failed CI

1. **Download trace artifact** from failed workflow
2. Run: `npm run trace:open`
3. Inspect visual timeline, network, console

## ✨ What's Protected

Your Tailwind v4.1 polish migration is now fully guarded:
- ✅ Removed 52 packages (tailwindcss-textshadow, @tailwindcss/aspect-ratio)
- ✅ Using built-in utilities (text-shadow-*, aspect-*)
- ✅ Custom utilities (.hover-glow, .card, .pressable)
- ✅ tw-animate-css integration
- ✅ Reduced-motion accessibility
- ✅ All changes tested on every PR

**Total Protection**: 4 automated tests running in ~2.5s on every style change.

🎉 **Ready for production!** Your UI polish is now CI/CD protected.
