# Deployment Attempt - Analysis & Next Steps

**Date**: October 21, 2025, 20:17 UTC  
**Workflow Run**: #18701335076  
**Status**: ‚ùå Failed (expected)  
**Error**: `404 Not Found` on `/ops/watchtower/update`

---

## What Happened

Attempted to trigger the "Redeploy Backend via Watchtower" GitHub Action workflow:

```bash
gh workflow run redeploy-backend.yml
# Run ID: 18701335076
```

**Result**: Workflow failed with HTTP 404

**Error Log**:
```
Triggering Watchtower to pull latest backend image...
HTTP Status: 404
Response: {"detail":"Not Found"}
##[error]Watchtower update failed with status 404
```

---

## Root Cause

The `/ops/watchtower/update` endpoint **doesn't exist on production yet** because:

1. ‚úÖ Configuration files committed to repo:
   - `deploy/docker-compose.portfolio-prod.yml` (has Watchtower service)
   - `deploy/nginx/nginx.prod.conf` (has `/ops/watchtower/update` location)

2. ‚ùå **But these files haven't been deployed to production server**:
   - Watchtower container not running
   - Nginx config not updated
   - `.env.production` with token not created

---

## What This Confirms

This 404 error is **expected and correct** because:

- We created all the configuration files
- We pushed them to GitHub
- **But the production server hasn't pulled and deployed them yet**

This is why the deployment guides emphasize "no SSH required **after initial setup**" - there's still a **one-time manual deployment** needed to get Watchtower running.

---

## Next Steps Required

### Option A: Manual Production Server Deployment (One-time)

**Someone with production server access needs to**:

```bash
# On production server
cd /path/to/deploy

# Pull latest config files
git pull origin main

# Create .env.production with token
cat > deploy/.env.production << 'EOF'
WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN=dsksLSbhyxH-0FRluEaPMVCzXE_o0duOVzXxfQZ-XGE
FIGMA_PAT=<actual-token>
EOF

# Deploy Watchtower + updated configs
docker compose -f docker-compose.portfolio-prod.yml pull
docker compose -f docker-compose.portfolio-prod.yml up -d

# Reload nginx
nginx -t && nginx -s reload
```

**After this one-time setup**, the GitHub Action will work for all future deployments.

---

### Option B: Alternative Deployment Without Watchtower

**If you can't access production server to set up Watchtower**, alternatives:

1. **Nightly Auto-Update** (if configured)
   - Wait for Watchtower's existing 5-minute check
   - But this requires Watchtower to be deployed first

2. **Manual Container Restart** (requires server access)
   ```bash
   docker compose pull backend
   docker compose up -d backend
   ```

3. **Use Existing Deployment Method**
   - If production has another deployment pipeline
   - Deploy via that method

---

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed (Local/GitHub)
- [x] All code changes committed and pushed
- [x] Watchtower configuration ready
- [x] GitHub Secrets configured
- [x] GitHub Action workflow created and tested
- [x] Backend fix ready in GHCR

### ‚è≥ Pending (Production Server)
- [ ] Deploy `docker-compose.portfolio-prod.yml` with Watchtower service
- [ ] Deploy `nginx.prod.conf` with `/ops/watchtower/update` endpoint
- [ ] Create `.env.production` with Watchtower token
- [ ] Start Watchtower container
- [ ] Verify endpoint accessible

### üéØ After Initial Setup
- [x] GitHub Action workflow ready to use
- [x] One-click deployments enabled
- [x] Force-pull capability ready

---

## Verification After Production Deployment

Once production server has been updated, run:

```bash
# Test Watchtower endpoint
curl -X POST https://api.leoklemet.com/ops/watchtower/update \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dsksLSbhyxH-0FRluEaPMVCzXE_o0duOVzXxfQZ-XGE"

# Should return JSON (not 404)
```

Then retry the GitHub Action:
```bash
gh workflow run redeploy-backend.yml
```

---

## Documentation References

All guides assume **production server has been updated first**:

- **WATCHTOWER_READY_TO_DEPLOY.md** - Assumes initial setup done
- **WATCHTOWER_DEPLOYMENT_EXECUTION.md** - Documents the required initial setup
- **WATCHTOWER_QUICK_COMMANDS.md** - Commands for after Watchtower is running

---

## Summary

**What we have**: Everything configured and ready in code  
**What's missing**: One-time production server deployment  
**Blocker**: Production server access needed for initial Watchtower setup  
**After setup**: GitHub Actions will work for all future deployments

The 404 error confirms the workflow is correct but production isn't ready yet.

---

## Recommended Action

1. **Get production server access** (Cloudflare console, tunnel, etc.)
2. **Run the 5 commands** from Option A above (~5 minutes)
3. **Verify endpoint** works (curl test)
4. **Re-run GitHub Action** - should succeed
5. **Verify `/api/dev/status`** - should return 200

After this one-time setup, all future deployments will be via GitHub Actions button click.
