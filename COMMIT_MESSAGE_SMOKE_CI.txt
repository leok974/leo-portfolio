chore(admin): add production smoke tests and CI integration for admin auth

Adds automated verification tools and CI guards to ensure admin authentication
stays functional in production/staging environments.

## New Files

### 1. Smoke Test Scripts (30-second verification)

**scripts/smoke-admin-prod.sh** (Bash):
- Login flow test
- Cookie extraction and validation
- /api/auth/me endpoint check
- Protected endpoints (200 with auth, 401 without)
- Automated cleanup

**scripts/smoke-admin-prod.ps1** (PowerShell):
- Windows-compatible version
- Same test coverage as bash script
- Colored output for better readability

Usage:
```bash
# Bash
SITE="https://assistant.ledger-mind.org" \
ADMIN_EMAIL="leoklemet.pa@gmail.com" \
bash scripts/smoke-admin-prod.sh

# PowerShell
$env:SITE = "https://assistant.ledger-mind.org"
$env:ADMIN_EMAIL = "leoklemet.pa@gmail.com"
.\scripts\smoke-admin-prod.ps1
```

### 2. CI Integration (.github/workflows/portfolio.yml)

Added `e2e-admin-staging` job that:
- Runs after build-and-test job completes
- Only executes if ADMIN_HMAC_SECRET is configured in GitHub secrets
- Tests admin authentication against staging
- Runs full E2E suite (tests/e2e/admin.auth.spec.ts)
- Uploads test reports as artifacts

This ensures:
- Admin auth doesn't break on deployment
- Backend stays properly wired
- Protected endpoints remain functional
- Immediate feedback on auth regressions

### 3. Documentation Updates

**STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md**:
- Added quick smoke test section (30 seconds)
- Both bash and PowerShell examples
- Expected output documentation

**ADMIN_AUTH_QUICKREF.md** (NEW):
- Comprehensive quick reference
- Smoke test commands
- Environment variables
- API endpoints
- Testing commands
- Troubleshooting
- CI integration details

## Benefits

1. **Fast Verification**: 30-second smoke test vs 5-minute manual workflow
2. **Automated CI Guard**: Catches auth breakage before production
3. **Cross-Platform**: Bash and PowerShell support
4. **Production-Safe**: Tests real endpoints without side effects
5. **Developer-Friendly**: Copy-paste commands in docs

## CI Workflow

```yaml
e2e-admin-staging:
  if: ${{ secrets.ADMIN_HMAC_SECRET != '' }}
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: build-and-test
  steps:
    - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
    - run: pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/admin.auth.spec.ts
```

Only runs when ADMIN_HMAC_SECRET is configured, preventing CI failures in
environments without admin auth setup.

## Testing

Tested smoke scripts against:
- [x] Local backend (http://127.0.0.1:8001)
- [ ] Staging (pending deployment)
- [ ] Production (pending deployment)

Expected results:
- Login: 200 with Set-Cookie
- /api/auth/me: {"is_admin": true, ...}
- Protected endpoints: 200 with cookie, 401 without
- Exit code: 0 on success, 1 on failure
