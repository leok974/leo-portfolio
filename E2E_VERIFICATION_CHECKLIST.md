## Verification Commands

Run these before committing:

```bash
# 1. Verify tests pass (serial)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/ops-agents.spec.ts --workers=1 --reporter=list

# Expected: 5 passed

# 2. Verify tests pass (parallel)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/ops-agents.spec.ts --reporter=list

# Expected: 5 passed

# 3. Verify stability
npx playwright test tests/e2e/ops-agents.spec.ts --repeat-each=2 --reporter=list

# Expected: 10 passed (5 tests × 2 repetitions)

# 4. Verify HTML report generation
npx playwright test tests/e2e/ops-agents.spec.ts --reporter=html

# Expected: Report in playwright-report/index.html

# 5. Verify E2E_LIVE mode (if backend running)
$env:E2E_LIVE="1"; npx playwright test tests/e2e/ops-agents.spec.ts --reporter=list

# Expected: Console log "⚠️  E2E_LIVE=1: Skipping API mocks"
```

## Post-Commit Verification

After pushing to GitHub:

1. **Check CI Run**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Find latest workflow run
   - Verify e2e job completes successfully

2. **Verify Artifacts**
   - Check "playwright-report-dev" artifact is uploaded
   - Check "playwright-report-strict" artifact is uploaded
   - Verify retention is 7 days

3. **Download and Inspect Report**
   - Download playwright-report-dev artifact
   - Extract and open index.html
   - Verify all 5 tests show as passed

## Rollback Plan

If tests fail in CI:

```bash
# 1. Revert .github/workflows/e2e.yml changes
git checkout HEAD~1 -- .github/workflows/e2e.yml

# 2. Tests can still run locally with:
npx playwright test tests/e2e/ops-agents.spec.ts
```
