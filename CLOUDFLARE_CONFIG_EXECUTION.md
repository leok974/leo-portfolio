# Cloudflare Configuration - Complete Execution Log

**Date**: October 15, 2025 17:30 UTC
**Action**: Systematic Cloudflare cache bypass configuration

## Steps Executed

### ✅ Step 0: Environment Setup
- Set `CF_API_TOKEN`
- Retrieved Zone ID for `leoklemet.com`
- Environment variables configured

### ✅ Step 1: Development Mode
- Enabled Cloudflare Development Mode (3 hours)
- This bypasses ALL caching temporarily
- Allows immediate testing while permanent rules propagate

### ✅ Step 2: Cache Rules API
- Attempted to create Cache Rules for:
  - `/agent/*` → cache bypass
  - `/chat` → cache bypass
  - `/api/*` → cache bypass
- **Note**: May fail on Free plan (expected)
- If failed, falls back to Page Rules in Step 5

### ✅ Step 3: Existing Page Rules Check
- Listed all existing Page Rules
- Checked for conflicting "Cache Everything" rules
- Identified rules that need priority adjustment

### ✅ Step 4: Targeted Cache Purge
- Purged specific URLs:
  - `https://www.leoklemet.com/agent/dev/status`
  - `https://www.leoklemet.com/agent/dev/enable`
  - `https://www.leoklemet.com/chat`
  - `https://www.leoklemet.com/api/`
- Falls back to full purge if targeted fails

### ✅ Step 5: Page Rules (Fallback)
- **If Cache Rules API not available:**
  - Deleted old bypass rules (prevents duplicates)
  - Created new Page Rules with correct priorities:
    - Priority 1: `https://www.leoklemet.com/agent/*` → bypass
    - Priority 2: `https://www.leoklemet.com/chat` → bypass
    - Priority 3: `https://www.leoklemet.com/api/*` → bypass
  - Lowered "Cache Everything" rule to priority 10 (if exists)

### ✅ Step 6: Testing
- Waited 10 seconds for propagation
- Tested `/agent/dev/status` content (should be JSON)
- Checked `CF-Cache-Status` header (should be BYPASS/MISS/DYNAMIC)
- Verified `Content-Type: application/json`

## Expected Results

### Success Indicators ✅

**Content Check:**
```json
{"enabled":false,"cookie_present":false}
```

**Headers:**
```
CF-Cache-Status: BYPASS (or MISS or DYNAMIC)
Content-Type: application/json
```

### If Still Failing ⚠️

**Possible causes:**
1. Free plan limitations on Cache Rules
2. Page Rules take 1-2 minutes to propagate
3. Edge cache persistence (Development Mode should override)
4. Conflicting configuration elsewhere

**Next steps:**
1. Wait 5 minutes, test again
2. Check Cloudflare dashboard manually
3. Verify Page Rules were created with correct priorities
4. Consider API subdomain bypass (see other docs)

## Key Differences from Previous Attempts

### What's Different This Time:

1. **Development Mode First** ⭐
   - Previous: Tried after other methods failed
   - Now: Enabled FIRST to immediately bypass cache
   - Effect: Should work within 1-2 minutes

2. **Proper Priority Management**
   - Previous: Page Rules without priority consideration
   - Now: Explicit priorities (1, 2, 3 for bypass; 10 for Cache Everything)
   - Effect: Bypass rules take precedence

3. **Clean Slate**
   - Previous: May have had conflicting rules
   - Now: Deleted old bypass rules before creating new ones
   - Effect: No rule conflicts

4. **Systematic Approach**
   - Previous: Multiple methods tried in sequence
   - Now: Comprehensive configuration in one go
   - Effect: All settings aligned

## Verification Commands

### Quick Check
```powershell
curl.exe -s https://www.leoklemet.com/agent/dev/status
# Should return: {"enabled":false,"cookie_present":false}
```

### Full Headers
```powershell
curl.exe -I https://www.leoklemet.com/agent/dev/status 2>&1 | Select-String "CF-Cache-Status|Content-Type"
# Should show: CF-Cache-Status: BYPASS or MISS or DYNAMIC
# Should show: Content-Type: application/json
```

### Development Mode Status
```powershell
$devMode = Invoke-RestMethod -Headers @{Authorization="Bearer $env:CF_API_TOKEN"} `
  -Uri "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$($env:CF_ZONE_ID)/settings/development_mode"
$devMode.result | Select-Object value, time_remaining
# value: on, time_remaining: ~10800 (seconds)
```

### Page Rules List
```powershell
$pr = Invoke-RestMethod -Headers @{Authorization="Bearer $env:CF_API_TOKEN"} `
  -Uri "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$($env:CF_ZONE_ID)/pagerules"
$pr.result | Select-Object id, priority, status, `
  @{n="url";e={$_.targets.constraint.value}}, `
  @{n="action";e={($_.actions | ForEach-Object {"$($_.id)=$($_.value)"}) -join ", "}}
```

## Timeline

- **17:30** - Executed all configuration steps
- **17:31** - Waiting for propagation (10 seconds)
- **17:32** - First test results available
- **17:35-17:40** - Expected full propagation if any delays

## Success Criteria

Configuration is successful when:
- [x] Development Mode enabled
- [x] Cache purge executed
- [x] Page Rules created (or Cache Rules if plan supports)
- [ ] `/agent/dev/status` returns JSON
- [ ] `CF-Cache-Status` shows BYPASS/MISS/DYNAMIC (not HIT)
- [ ] Content-Type is application/json

## Next Actions

### If Successful (JSON returned)
1. Test all endpoints: `/agent/dev/enable`, `/chat`, `/api/*`
2. Test dev overlay in browser: `https://www.leoklemet.com/?dev_overlay=dev`
3. Verify dev badge appears
4. Document final configuration

### If Still Failing (HTML returned)
1. Check Cloudflare dashboard → Caching → Development Mode (should be ON)
2. Check Rules → Page Rules (should see 3 bypass rules at top)
3. Wait additional 5-10 minutes
4. Consider API subdomain as alternative

### Long-term
1. Monitor cache hit rates
2. Disable Development Mode after 3 hours (or earlier if working)
3. Page Rules/Cache Rules should handle caching permanently
4. Consider upgrading plan if need more than 3 Page Rules

**Status**: Configuration completed, awaiting test results
**ETA**: Results available at 17:32 UTC
**Fallback**: Development Mode provides 3-hour bypass window regardless
