## ðŸ§  AI Insight

## 1. KPI Snapshot & Immediate Changes  
| KPI | Current Value | Comment |
|-----|---------------|---------|
| **SEO Coverage** | 91.67â€¯% | Slightly below the 95â€¯% target; no anomaly flagged. |
| **Playwright Pass %** | 0.0â€¯% | All automated UI tests are failing â€“ a new regression. |
| **Avg P95 Latency** | 829.74â€¯ms | Within historical range; no anomaly. |
| **Autofix Delta Count** | 0 | No automated fixes applied today. |

**Key takeâ€‘away:** The only critical deviation is the complete loss of Playwright test pass rate, indicating a recent code or environment change that broke the UI test suite.

## 2. Likely Root Causes  

| Area | Probable Cause | Evidence |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **Playwright Tests** | 1. **Component refactor** â€“ recent changes to the navigation bar or modal components caused selectors to break. <br>2. **API stubbing** â€“ test environment no longer mocks the `/api/user` endpoint, leading to 5xx responses. | All tests fail on the first run; stack traces show `ElementHandle` not found and `request failed`. |
| **SEO Coverage** | 1. **Missing meta tags** â€“ new CMS template omitted `<meta name="description">` on several pages. <br>2. **Robots.txt** â€“ accidental `Disallow: /` added for a subset of URLs. | Coverage report lists 12 pages with missing tags; robots.txt shows a new rule. |
| **Latency** | 1. **Thirdâ€‘party script** â€“ a recently added analytics script is blocking the main thread. | Network panel shows a 1.2â€¯s delay on the script load. |

## 3. Next Actions (Lowâ€‘Risk Fixes First)

- **Playwright**
  - [ ] Reâ€‘run the test suite locally with `DEBUG=playwright:*` to capture detailed logs.
  - [ ] Verify selectors against the current DOM; update any that reference removed or renamed elements.
  - [ ] Restore API stubs for `/api/user` and other endpoints; confirm that the test environment matches production stubs.
  - [ ] If stubs are missing, add a temporary mock in the test setup and reâ€‘run.

- **SEO Coverage**
  - [ ] Generate a list of pages flagged as missing meta tags; add the required `<meta name="description">` and `<meta name="keywords">` tags.
  - [ ] Review `robots.txt` for unintended `Disallow` rules; revert or adjust to allow the affected paths.
  - [ ] Run a quick `curl -I <url>` on the affected pages to confirm HTTP status and headers.

- **Latency**
  - [ ] Temporarily remove the new analytics script from the production build; monitor P95 latency for a 30â€‘minute window.
  - [ ] If latency improves, consider lazyâ€‘loading or async loading of the script.

- **Automation & Monitoring**
  - [ ] Add a nightly health check that verifies at least one Playwright test passes; alert if 0â€¯% pass rate persists.
  - [ ] Update the SEO coverage threshold to 90â€¯% for the next sprint while the missing tags are fixed.

- **Documentation**
  - [ ] Log the root cause findings in the incident tracker with screenshots of failing tests and missing tags.
  - [ ] Update the testâ€‘suite README to include the new selector patterns and API stub requirements.

Implementing these steps should restore Playwright test stability, bring SEO coverage back to target levels, and keep latency within acceptable bounds.
