docs(backend): streamlined quickstart with correct email and improved structure

Updates to BACKEND_QUICKSTART.md:

1. Correct Admin Email:
   - Changed from placeholder "you@yourdomain.com" to actual "leoklemet.pa@gmail.com"
   - Used throughout all code examples and curl commands
   - Updated environment variable examples

2. Improved Auth Module:
   - Added 5-minute clock skew tolerance in _verify()
   - Smart cookie configuration (dev vs prod)
   - Local dev uses SameSite=lax (same-origin)
   - Prod uses SameSite=none + Secure (cross-subdomain)
   - Conditional COOKIE_DOMAIN (None for local, .ledger-mind.org for prod)

3. Reorganized Structure:
   - Added Step 0: Pre-requisites (one-time setup)
   - Clear separation between local dev and production configs
   - Improved Step 8: Common Gotchas with detailed fixes
   - Added verification checklist (15 items)

4. Enhanced Examples:
   - PowerShell AND bash examples for all commands
   - Explicit SameSite/Domain handling in set_cookie
   - Better curl smoke test with expected outputs
   - Complete nginx configuration snippets

5. Production Focus:
   - Clear prod vs dev differences documented
   - CORS configuration with explicit origins (no wildcards)
   - Cookie attributes for subdomain support
   - Replica secret sharing requirements

6. Verification Steps:
   - Step-by-step local testing (5 min)
   - Complete staging/prod smoke tests
   - Playwright E2E test examples (local + prod)
   - Common gotchas with quick fixes

Key Improvements:
- Clock skew handling (5 min grace period)
- Smart cookie config (auto-detect dev vs prod)
- Explicit ADMIN_EMAILS parsing (strip + lowercase)
- Better error messages ("not in admin allowlist")
- Complete require_admin() dependency implementation

Testing:
- All examples use leoklemet.pa@gmail.com
- Local dev tested on http://127.0.0.1:8001
- Prod tested on https://assistant.ledger-mind.org
- E2E tests ready with PW_SITE and PW_API vars
