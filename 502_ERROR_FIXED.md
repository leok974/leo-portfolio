# 🔧 502 Error Fixed - Backend Proxying Disabled

**Date:** October 20, 2025 16:37 UTC
**Commit:** `d452fe2`
**Root Cause:** Nginx trying to proxy to non-existent `assistant.ledger-mind.org`

---

## 🔴 Problem Identified

Your site was showing **HTTP 502 Bad Gateway** because:

1. ❌ `VITE_BACKEND_ENABLED=1` was set in production
2. ❌ Nginx was configured to proxy `/api/`, `/chat`, `/chat/stream` to `assistant.ledger-mind.org`
3. ❌ **`assistant.ledger-mind.org` DOES NOT EXIST** - DNS cannot resolve it
4. ❌ When users accessed the site, nginx tried to proxy requests to a non-existent domain
5. ❌ Result: 502 Bad Gateway errors

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Disabled Backend Features
**File:** `apps/portfolio-ui/.env.production`
```diff
- VITE_BACKEND_ENABLED=1
+ VITE_BACKEND_ENABLED=0
```

**Effect:** Frontend will no longer make `/api/*` calls that would fail

### 2. Commented Out Nginx Proxy Locations
**File:** `deploy/nginx.portfolio-dev.conf`

Disabled these proxy locations:
- ❌ `/api/` → commented out
- ❌ `/chat` → commented out
- ❌ `/chat/stream` → commented out

**Effect:** Nginx will serve static files only, won't try to proxy to non-existent backend

### 3. Committed and Pushed
```bash
git commit -m "fix: disable backend API proxying - assistant.ledger-mind.org doesn't exist"
git push origin main
```

**Commit:** `d452fe2`

## 🚀 Deployment in Progress

**Workflow Triggered:** Rebuilding Docker image with fixed configuration

**Timeline:**
```
16:37 UTC - Fix committed ✅
16:38 UTC - Workflow dispatched ⏳
16:41 UTC - Build completes (est.) ⏳
16:42 UTC - Image pushed to GHCR (est.) ⏳
16:45 UTC - Watchtower pulls image (est.) ⏳
16:46 UTC - Site back online (est.) ⏳
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Result

Once deployment completes:

✅ **Site will load correctly** (HTTP 200)
✅ **No more 502 errors**
✅ **Static content works** (HTML, JS, CSS, images)
✅ **Health check passes** (`/healthz` returns "ok")
❌ **Backend features disabled** (chat, API calls won't work)

## 📋 What Needs to Happen for Full Backend Support

To re-enable backend features, you need to:

### Option A: Deploy Backend Locally on Same Server
```bash
# Your backend container is already running locally at 127.0.0.1:8001
# Just update nginx to proxy to it:

location /api/ {
  proxy_pass http://host.docker.internal:8001/api/;
  # ... (other settings)
}
```

Then set `VITE_BACKEND_ENABLED=1` and rebuild.

### Option B: Set Up assistant.ledger-mind.org Domain
1. **Register or configure DNS** for `assistant.ledger-mind.org`
2. **Point it to your backend server**
3. **Deploy backend** at that domain
4. **Uncomment nginx proxy locations**
5. **Set `VITE_BACKEND_ENABLED=1`**
6. **Rebuild and deploy**

### Option C: Use Existing leoklemet.com Domain
```nginx
# Update nginx to proxy to same server
location /api/ {
  proxy_pass http://localhost:8001/api/;
  # OR
  proxy_pass http://portfolio-backend:8001/api/;
}
```

Backend runs on same host, different port or container name.

## 🔍 Verify Fix After Deployment

### Test Site is Up
```powershell
curl -I https://www.leoklemet.com
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK (not 502)
```

### Test Health Check
```powershell
curl https://www.leoklemet.com/healthz
# Expected: "ok"
```

### Test Static Assets
```powershell
curl -I https://www.leoklemet.com/assets/main-*.js
# Expected: HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

### Browser Test
1. Open https://www.leoklemet.com
2. Should load without errors
3. Console should show no 502 errors
4. Static portfolio should display correctly

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

Until backend is properly deployed:

- ❌ Chat functionality disabled
- ❌ `/api/layout` calls won't work
- ❌ Admin features unavailable
- ❌ Dynamic content from backend won't load
- ✅ Static portfolio content works fine
- ✅ Projects, skills, images all work
- ✅ Client-side features work

---

## 📊 Monitoring

Watch workflow progress:
```powershell
gh run watch $(gh run list --workflow=refresh-content.yml --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')
```

Test site every 30 seconds:
```powershell
while ($true) {
    $r = try { Invoke-WebRequest "https://www.leoklemet.com" -Method Head -TimeoutSec 5 } catch { $null }
    if ($r.StatusCode -eq 200) {
        Write-Host "✅ SITE IS UP!" -ForegroundColor Green
        break
    }
    Write-Host "⏳ Still deploying..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
    Start-Sleep 30
}
```

**Status:** 🟡 **DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS**
**ETA:** ~8 minutes for site to be fully operational
**Priority:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** - Site currently down

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. ✅ **Always verify domains exist** before configuring proxies
2. ✅ **Test DNS resolution** before deployment
3. ✅ **Set `VITE_BACKEND_ENABLED=0`** by default until backend is ready
4. ✅ **Use health checks** that don't depend on external services
5. ✅ **Comment out proxy configs** for non-existent backends

---

**Next Steps:**
1. ⏳ Wait for workflow to complete (~3 min)
2. ⏳ Wait for Watchtower to pull image (~5 min)
3. ✅ Test site is accessible
4. 📋 Decide on backend deployment strategy (Option A, B, or C above)
